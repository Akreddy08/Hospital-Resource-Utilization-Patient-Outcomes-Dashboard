# Hospital-Resource-Utilization-Patient-Outcomes-Dashboard
Interactive analytics dashboard for monitoring hospital resource utilization, patient flow, operational bottlenecks, and patient outcomes across departments and branches in a multi-specialty hospital network in India.
# 🏥 Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement
Hospitals often face challenges in efficiently managing beds, doctors, emergency cases, and patient flow due to lack of centralized and interpretable analytics. This project aims to design and build an interactive analytics dashboard for hospital operations teams to monitor, analyze, and optimize resource utilization across departments in a mid-sized multi-specialty hospital network in India.
